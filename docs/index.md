Use triple dashes (like below) to separate sections of your text

Remember you can use `single backticks` to quote code inline, or use triple
backticks to make a blockquote of code (you can even specify the language,
if you want).

```markdown

# Quoted Markdown

When this is put on the web this will appear in the in raw Markdown. That is,
this will appear inside a code blockquote, this will not be rendered as
part of the webpage. Instead, it will look very similar to how you are seeing
it now, inside the editor.

You can do this for pretty much any language or format we
have run into for this class...

* python
* csv
* json
* et.c.

## The Proposal

### Introduction

Basketball is currently one of the most played sports worldwide. Basketball was invented in the United States in 1891 by James Naismith and initially consisted of pick-up games that made players score the ball inside of a basketball hoop. Basketball quickly grew popular and a league where teams competed against each other was formed in 1898. The popularity of basketball constantly grew and led to the formation of a new professional league, the National Basketball Association (NBA), in 1946. Another league, the American Basketball Association (ABA), was formed in 1967, however the ABA and NBA later merged together in 1976 under the name of the NBA. Today, the NBA and basketball in general continues to grow thanks to the fans and the players.

In this proposal, I aim to target how key figures, such as Bill Russell and Michael Jordan, helped revolutionize basketball and led the NBA to become what it is today.

![Bill Russell](https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/bill-russell-getty2.jpg)

Originally basketball began as a white-dominated league with few, if any, minorities. However, this all changed as soon as Bill Russell arrived in the NBA. By dealing with the criticisms and racist comments and proving everyone making those comments wrong, Russell opened up a path for black athletes in the NBA. The path opened up by Russell led the NBA to become a black-dominated league, paving the path for future NBA legends such as Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan to be successful in the NBA. Lastly, this Boston Celtics legend has one of the most significant accolades held by a single NBA player, as he played from 1956 to 1969, served as a player and coach from 1966 to 1969, leading his team is eleven championship titles, currently still the most championships won by a single player.

![Yao Ming](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-02/04/136031062_14862621961471n.jpg)

Bill Russell wasn't the only person to pave the way for a non-white race to come into the NBA, as Yao Ming helped bring more Asians into the NBA. Yao destroyed all of the stereotypes of Asians being to small, as this 7'6" giant came into the league as one of the tallest players to play in the NBA. Though his career was cut short due to injuries, this Hall of Fame basketball star was able to inspire fellow Asians, such as Yi Jianlian and Jeremy Lin, to attempt a career in the NBA.

![Michael and Scottie](https://mk0slamonlinensgt39k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/rsz_gettyimages-71052255.jpg)

Michael Jordan, known to many basketball fans as the GOAT (Greatest-Of-All-Time), . Jordan, along with Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen, led the Chicago Bulls to a total of six NBA Finals appearances, and a total of six championships, therefore being undefeated in an NBA Finals matchup. Michael Jordan not only revolutionized the NBA, he revolutionized the world through Air Jordan, a sub-company of Nike that produces shoes, clothing, and accessories. Air Jordan became the most succesful brand from a basketball player, and inspired other NBA players to create their own shoes and clothing lines.

![Kobe and Lebron](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Yos1O3PH67Rq840-NwRgQ0waag=/0x105:3000x2105/1200x800/filters:focal(0x105:3000x2105)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/48779957/GettyImages-462505396.0.jpg)

Lastly there is the "Black Mamba" Kobe Bryant, and "The King" LeBron James. By following the path that Michael Jordan set for them, these two desired to become the greatest. One step that both Bryant and James was signing with Nike, thus creating their own signature shoes, and is one of the most popular Nike shoes on the market.

### Workflow

When are where you think you might use certain information sources, let the
reader know which sources of information you are going to use, and how you
intend to get information from that source in a useable format.

Next, to whatever extent possible, let the reader understand how you envision
the overall workflow. That is, how do you intend to get from a to z. At this
stage, you probably have a lot of uncertainties, but you should try to think
this out as much as possible. What tool(s) do you intend to use for scraping?
For cleaning, visualizing? Will you have to transform the data into different
formats, if so how? How ensure that group members are not constantly waiting
on a single member to complete their phase? Can you think of ways that group
members can get updates in advance of the finished work, so that they can
start their own work?

---

### Scholarship

Here is where you should expand a bit on any relevant scholarship, whether
digital or historical. If you refer to authors in your bibliography, you need
only use parenthetical (author, year) notation. If you are referring to a web
resource, you can always link directly to it.

This section should not be a large histiographical essay going on about the
merits or drawbacks of different individuals. That kind of discussion can go
in your final project. Instead, this should be a place to let your reader know
in the space of several paragraphs the basic schools of thought or important
works of scholarship that relate to your project. More importantly, you can
suggest what (potentially) a digital project such as the one you are proposing
could say to such a debate.

Remember that you can and should talk about both digital and historical
scholarship, when relevant. [Digital Humanities Quarterly](www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/)
is a good starting point.

Rather than think of this as a discussion about others, it might be more
helpful to think of it like this: in academia there are lots of scattered, but
important conversations going on, you can have more impact when you can connect
what you are saying to more and more of these conversations. So, you can think
of it like selling your project by linking it to its possible links to others.
